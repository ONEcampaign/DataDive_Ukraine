# Data Dive: The Russian Invasion of Ukraine

This repository powers the analysis for the trade visualizations on the page: 
[Data Dive:The Russian Invasion of Ukraine](https://www.one.org/africa/issues/covid-19-tracker/explore-ukraine/)  
using data from [Centre d'Etudes Prospectives et d'Informations Internationales]() (CEPII). 
The [BACI dataset](http://www.cepii.fr/cepii/en/bdd_modele/presentation.asp?id=37) 
provides disaggregated bilateral trade flow data using official data from
[COMTRADE](https://comtrade.un.org/). Visualizations are created using 
[Flourish](https://flourish.studio/).

In order to reproduce the analysis Python (>=3.10) is needed. Additionally, 
trade data is too large to be stored in this repository and needs to be manually 
downloaded from [BACI](http://www.cepii.fr/cepii/en/bdd_modele/presentation.asp?id=37).


The repository includes the following subfolders:
- `output`
- `raw_data`
- `scripts`
