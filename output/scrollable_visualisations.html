    <p>Russia has more agricultural land than all other European countries combined.
        Ukraine has the most arable land in Europe. It has 25% of the world’s total volume of black soil, which is
        particularly fertile and has helped make the country a global agricultural powerhouse.
        <a href="#story/1162769/slide-3"></a>
    </p>

    <p>
        Together Russia and Ukraine supply 30% of the world’s wheat and 24% of barley.
        Ukraine accounts for 13% of global corn exports. Ukraine also accounts for 46% of sunflower oil
        exports — making it the world’s top exporter.<br><br>The majority of these exports go through Odessa and other
        ports on the

            Sea, which are now closed to commercial shipping</a>. While most wheat and barley crops are harvested in the
        summer and exported during the fall, maize exports tend to continue through spring. Large areas
        of Ukraine’s production border Russia. The conflict is likely to disrupt planting for 2022.

        <br><br>Sanctions will raise the price of fertilizer, which will impact African farmers.

    <p>
        The cost of wheat in early March was 80% higher than six months earlier.
        The cost of maize is seeing similar rises.
        <a href="#story/1162769/slide-7"></a>
    </p>

    <p>
        The domino effects are even more complex. In January,
        the UN’s <a href="https://www.fao.org/worldfoodsituation/foodpricesindex/en/">Vegetable Oil Index </a>was
        at its highest level ever recorded. <br><br> In the absence of sunflower oil exports from Ukraine,
        buyers <a
            href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/palm-oil-becomes-costliest-vegetable-oil-as-ukraine-war-halts-sunflower-oil-supply-8178701.html">
        are switching</a> to palm oil, which hit record highs on futures markets in early March. Palm oil is
        a staple for cooking in West Africa.
        <a href="#story/1162769/slide-8"></a>
    </p>

    <p>
        Because food prices are determined on international markets, these shifts will have indirect effects on every
        African country. Some African countries are net exporters of food and may see their exports increase,
        including South Africa’s maize exports. But the net impacts will be negative.
        <a href="#story/1162769/slide-9"></a>

    <p>
        Ukraine and Russia also have direct trading relationships with Africa.
        <a href="#story/1162769/slide-11"></a>
    </p>

    <p>
        Exports from Russia and Ukraine to African countries total about $US14.5 billion per year.
        <a href="#story/1162769/slide-12"></a>
    </p>

    <p>
        About half of exports to Africa are directed to three countries:
        <br><br><strong>Egypt</strong> ($US4.5 billion per year on average)
        <a href="#story/1162769/slide-13"></a>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Morocco</strong> (worth $US1.9 billion per year on average)
        <a href="#story/1162769/slide-14"></a>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>and Algeria</strong> (worth $US1.5 billion per year on average)
        <a href="#story/1162769/slide-15"></a>
    </p>

    <p>
        In financial terms, primary exports to African countries are <b>wheat</b> (US$4.8 billion),
        <b>oil</b> (US$2.3 billion), <b>industrial supplies</b> (US$2.1 billion), and <b>steel and iron</b>
        (US$1.6 billion) per year.
        <a href="#story/1162769/slide-16"></a>
    </p>

    <p>
        But the underlying story lies in the strategic importance of Russia and Ukraine for some countries.
        <br><br>For example, they represent about 50% of Africa’s wheat imports<br><br>
        <a href="#story/1162769/slide-17"></a>
    </p>

    <p>
        For Eritrea, Egypt, Benin, Sudan, Djibouti, and Tanzania they make up over 70% of
        <b>wheat</b> imports.
        <a href="#story/1162769/slide-18"></a>
    </p>

    <p>
        And they make up more than 90% of <b>sunflower oil</b> imports to Egypt, Tunisia, Sudan, and Algeria.

    <p>
        Vegetable oil costs could more than double, compared to their price before the war. This will have significant
        consequences for countries like Egypt, Kenya or South Africa. Together, they could end up paying an additional
        $US 2.7 billion per year to import palm and sunflower oil.
        <a href="#story/1332165/slide-2"></a>
    </p>

    <p>
        Relative to the size of the population, countries like Benin, Mauritania, Togo and Kenya will be among the most
        impacted. For example, Benin’s vegetable oil imports’ bill per person could be as much as 9 times what it spent
        on health in 2019.
        <a href="#story/1332165/slide-3"></a>
    </p>

    <p>
        Even before the war, countries like Egypt, Algeria or Morocco spent billions in wheat and maize imports. Higher
        prices on food imports will cost billions and have huge economic impacts.
        <a href="#story/1332165/slide-4"></a>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Egypt’s</strong> wheat and maize bill could go up by US$ 4.4 billion - assuming prices don’t continue to rise. <a
            href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/g20-failing-poorer-countries-on-debt-relief-says-imf-9gnw8rpsk">Egypt
        is already seeking a bailout</a> as soaring prices and debt put huge pressure on budgets.<br><br><strong>Algeria</strong> may
        have to spend an additional US$2.8 billion - equivalent to 22 times what it will spend in debt service this
        year. <strong>Sudan’s</strong> bill will increase by over $630 million, as much as it will pay in debt service.
